# Pokémon Browser

## About The Project
This React app uses the PokeAPI to create a simple Pokémon browser. It features a "Load More" button that allows users to continuously load more Pokémon data without reloading the page. This project is perfect for those looking to understand API integration and state management in React.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Fetch Pokémon data from the PokeAPI.
- **Infinite Pagination**: Implement "Load More" functionality to paginate data seamlessly.
- **React State Management**: Utilize React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage state and side effects.

## Built With
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
